Use \cs {orig@dump} as flag instead of \cs {adddialect}

* babel~3.9a (2012/08/11)
Now switch.def is loaded always, so that there is no need to rebuild formats just to update babel

* babel~3.9a (2012/08/12)
Revised the loading mechanism

* babel~3.9i (2014/03/01)

* babel~3.9a (2012/06/28)
Added the \cs {AfterBabelLanguage} mechanism, to be used mainly with the local cfg file.

Bug fix - extra spaces because a missing percent

* babel~3.9s (2017/04/10)
\cs {bbl@ensure@lang} defined only once

* babel~3.10 (2017/05/06)
\cs {bbl@ensured} renamed to \cs {bbl@captionslist} (for \cs {babelprovide}), which means \cs {today} must be given explicitly in \cs {babelensure}

* babel~3.9a (2012/08/11)
\cs {ldf@quit} is not delayed any more after \cs {fi} , since \cs {endinput} is not executed immediately

Preset the ``family'' of macros \cs {Babel}...

* babel~3.9a (2012/10/01)

Removed an extra hash. Now calls \cs {@initiate@active@char} with 3 arguments.

* babel~3.9e (2012/08/18)

The catcode is saved

* babel~3.9a (2012/09/09)

* babel~3.9a (2012/12/27)
Shorthands are not defined directly, but with a couple of intermediate macros

* babel~3.9a (2012/08/18)
Instead of the ``copy-paste pattern'' a new macro is used

* babel~3.9a[[2012/8/18[[Use \cs {user@group}, as above, instead of the hardwired \texttt {user}

* babel~3.9a (2012/09/11)
The output routine resets the quote to \cs {active@math@prime}, so we redefine the latter with the new ``normal'' value

Added a couple of missing comment characters (PR 4146)

* babel~3.9a (2012/07/29)

Removed the intermediate step of \cs {bbl@act@caret} and moved above

* babel~3.9i (2012/12/29)
Added the event \cs {initiateactive}

* babel~3.9a (2012/07/04)
Catcodes are also restored after each language, to prevent incompatibilities. Use \cs {string} instead of \cs {noexpand} and add \cs {relax}

* babel~3.9a (2012/10/18)
Catcodes are deactivated in a separate macro, which is made no-op when babel exits

* babel~3.9a (2012/08/18)
Removed \cs {string}s, because the char are already string'ed

* babel 3.35 (2019/09/18)
Added \cs {ifincsname} test.

* babel~3.9a (2013/01/11)
\cs {bbl@withactive} makes sure the catcode is active

* babel~3.9a (2012/07/03)
Check if shorthands are redefined

* babel~3.9a (2012/12/29)
Failed if an argument had a condicional. Use the more robust mechanism of \cs {XXXoftwo}

* babel~3.9a (2012/08/05)
Now \cs {bbl@activate} makes sure the catcode is active, so this part is simplified

* babel~3.9a (2012/08/12)
User shorhands can be defined even with shorthands=off

* babel~3.9a (2012/08/05)
Added optional argument, to provide a way to (re)define language shorthands

* babel~3.9a (2012/08/25)
Extended for language-dependent user macros, with two new auxiliary macros

* babel~3.9a (2012/08/06)
Instead of letting the new shorthand to the original char, which very often didn't work, we define it directly

* babel~3.9a (2012/08/20)
Make sure both characters (old an new) are active

* babel~3.9a (2013/02/21)
