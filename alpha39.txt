When investigating babel/3800 I discovered some issues to be addressed
related to options, mainly the fact combining package and global
options has not a well-defined behaviour (the main language sometimes
is the last named one, but sometimes it's not). The doc says you can use
package options OR global options, but this is not enforced and it can
be done without complaint (just with an unexpected behaviour).

Furthermore, ldf files not bundled with babel are not recognized as
global options. So, I've added some code to make sure global options
are properly recognized, to raise an error (or perhaps only a warning,
I'm not sure) if the main language is not the last named one and to
set explicitly the main language in cases like

\documentclass[ngerman]{book}
\usepackage[english,ngerman]{babel}

Oddly, this set english as the main language. Now it complains with a
message saying you have to use

\usepackage[english,main=ngerman]{babel}

To seize the opportunity, I've added another option which I had
already written, to control shorthands (but not yet tested
thoroughly). --javier

One of the problems one must face when loading files from different
sources and authors is that of incompatibilities. While packages can be
loaded separately and there are tools like \PassOptionsToPackage,
babel languages are loaded in one go, and there is no way to insert some
code among them.

I've analyzed 5 approaches:

1) Loading a 'prebabel' package which would define \AtEndOfLanguage,
with code to be used when the main babel package is loaded. I find
this somewhat clumsy, but it could be useful if other packages and
classes need to preset some option.

2) Delaying the loading of all languages to a \babelinput, so that you
can use \AtEndOfLanguage. After some tests, I still find it a bit
confusing, and you can do nothing before loading babel (eg, "passing"
some option to a language) .

3) Delaying the loading of separate languages, so that
\AtEndOfLanguage is not required. This option doesn't seem possible
with current babel.

4) Loading named local config files, much like bblopts.cfg but only
when requested (with a package option config=file). This could useful
in general and I've added it. However, presetting options is not easy
(but not impossible).

5) Executing macros following certain naming conventions (eg,
\babelafteritalian), so that you can define them with
\(re)newcommand. Unfortunately, this leaves to the user the
responsibility of defining them in the proper way (remember LaTeX
doesn't provide a way to add stuff to an existing macro).

Well, there are still further approaches, like having package options
after-latin=\string\dosomething or after-latin=dosomething, but things
are getting worse. --javier

Bugs discovered recently are related to patterns and primes.

Patterns were loaded before the previous language was closed (even before \originalTeX). Now are loaded after the selected language has been setup (after \extras...).

Primes and hats are not handled correctly. The following raises an error ( Double superscript ):

  \usepackage[activeacute,catalan,esperanto]{babel}
  \begin{document}
  $f'^2$
  \end{document}

And the following, too:

  \usepackage[activeacute,catalan]{babel}
  \begin{document}
  \shorthandoff{'}
  $f'''$
  \end{document}

The switching mechanism of \foreignlanguage and otherlanguage* does not work correctly, because \originalTeX is either missing or incorrectly built. For example, with

  \usepackage[german,greek]{babel}
  \begin{document}
  Greek
  \begin{otherlanguage*}{german}
  German
  \end{otherlanguage*}
  Greek
  \end{document}

the German text is typeset using Greek characters. The aux file is
wrong, too. Now, except for the date and captions groups, they will
mimic the behaviour of \selectlanguage (in other words, they will
share the code). --javier
