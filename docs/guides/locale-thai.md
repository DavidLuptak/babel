# Hebrew

Hebrew is available for `xetex` and `luatex`, but the
preferred engine is the latter. In the latter, it should work with the
defualt font renderer and Harfbuzz.

There is a complete example (with `microtype`) in the repository
([tex](https://github.com/latex3/babel/blob/main/samples/lua-thai.tex), 
[pdf](https://github.com/latex3/babel/blob/main/samples/lua-thai.pdf)).
