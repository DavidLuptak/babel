# Using babel with Plain

(*Under development*)

As explained in the manual, not all languages provide a `sty` file and
some of them are not compatible with Plain. This document will explain
how to use `babel` with Plain, because the information in the manual
(for LaTeX) is almost non-existent (just a few lines).

Currently, support for Plain is mostly in a maintenance mode, which
means **many of the features added in the last few months (well, years)
won't work**.

It is worth noting Babel is *not* compatible with the original Plain,
but rather with a format named `blplain` (admittedly, the manual is
somewhat misleading in this regard). Apparently this format has never
found its way into most of distributions. Version 3.9 added support for
e-Plain, because the changes to achieve it were minimal. **When the
manual refers to Plain, it actually means e-Plain and pdf-Plain**, which
are the formats used *de facto* in most cases.
