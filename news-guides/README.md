<b>Localization and internationalization ◾ pdfTeX, LuaTeX and XeTeX</b>
</p>

This is the home page for Babel, a multilingual environment for latex (and sometimes plain) for the three basic engines (pdfTeX, LuaTeX and XeTeX). Its aim is to provide a localization framework for different languages, scripts, and cultures based on the latest advances in Unicode and other technologies.
